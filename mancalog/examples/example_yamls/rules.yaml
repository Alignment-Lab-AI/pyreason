# All Rules come under here
# rule_1 says:
# Nodes that have the success label with bounds between 0 and 1, will be influenced next timestep if half its neighbors have success between 0.5 and 1
rule_1:
    target: success      # Target label

    target_criteria:    # List of all target criteria
        # All criteria come here in the form [label, lower_bound, upper_bound]
        - [success, 0, 1]

    delta_t: 1          # Delta t, time when this rule is applicable

    neigh_nodes:        # List of all neighbour nodes
        - [success, 0.5, 1]

    neigh_edges:        # List of all neighbour edges (null for None)
        null

    influence: sft_tp   # Influence function name. Available influence functions are: tp, ng_tp, sft_tp

# Start of next rule
