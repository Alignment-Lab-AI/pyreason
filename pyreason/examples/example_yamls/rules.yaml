# All Rules come under here
# rule_1 says:
# Nodes that have the success label with bounds between 0 and 1, will be influenced next timestep if half its neighbors have success between 0.5 and 1
rule_1:
    target: success     # Target label

    target_criteria:    # List of all target criteria
        # All criteria come here in the form [label, lower_bound, upper_bound]
        - [success, 0.0, 1.0]

    delta_t: 1          # Delta t, time when this rule is applicable

    neigh_criteria:     # List of all neighbour criteria in the form [criteria on node/edge, label, [lower_bound, upper_bound], [equal/greater/less/greater_equal/less_equal, number/percent, value]]
        - [[node, success, [0.5, 1.0], [greater_equal, percent, 50]]]

    ann_fn: sft_tp   # Annotation function name. Available influence functions are: tp, ng_tp, sft_tp

# Start of next rule
rule_2:
