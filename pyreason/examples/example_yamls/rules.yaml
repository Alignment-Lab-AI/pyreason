# All Rules come under here. Make sure each rule name is different otherwise it'll get overridden
# rule_1 says:
# Nodes that have the success label with bounds between 0 and 1, will be influenced next timestep if half its neighbors have success between 0.5 and 1
rule_1:

    target_criteria:    # List of all target criteria

                                     # See annotation_functions.py for list of available functions. The name of that function comes here
